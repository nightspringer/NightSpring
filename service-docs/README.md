# service-docs

Important documents used across the Retrospring website.

## Localization

To translate a specific document into your language (main site is not supporting this as of now), create a folder for your language based on [ISO-639-1 language code standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) and place the translated document into the same structure as the original one.

So `en/policy/terms.md` becomes `de/policy/terms.md` for example.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute a translation into your language, please fork this repository and make your changes, afterwards make a pull request, so we can check on the translation and approve it's addition.

People that contribute wrong translations on purpose won't get any following PRs accepted.

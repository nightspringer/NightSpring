# Security Policy

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in Retrospring (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can reach us at <security@retrospring.net>.

You should *not* report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing Retrospring's users to increased risk.

## Scope

A "vulnerability in Retrospring" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.

## Supported Versions

As long as Retrospring is in rapid development pace the currently supported version for security issues is always the [latest tagged release](https://github.com/Retrospring/retrospring/releases/latest).

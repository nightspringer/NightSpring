  # About

  **NightSpring** is a small and cozy Q&A site built for Twitter users and writers.

  This site is a space to share thoughts, interact with your followers, and ask or answer questions — anonymously if you’d like.

  NightSpring is lovingly maintained by a single person. That means moderation is handled manually, and to keep the space safe, **sign-ups may close soon**.

  Be kind. Be curious. Be respectful. And please note: **NightSpring is for users 18+ only.**
